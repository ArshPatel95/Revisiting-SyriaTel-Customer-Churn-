# Revisiting-SyriaTel-Customer-Churn-

I am revisiting the Phase 3 Project I did for Flatiron School. I worked with the SyriaTel dataset to predict customer churn. During the program, I had just began my career as a data scientist. Now, with more knowlegde, and less time constraints, I will revisit the project to make a better customer churn predictor.
